        UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        In Star Trek, the Star Wars saga, and virtually all other science fiction films, remarkably, all the aliens speak perfect
        English. This is because there is something called the “universal translator” that allows earthlings to communicate
        instantly with any alien civilization, removing the inconvenience of tediously using sign language and primitive
        gestures to communicate with an alien.
    </p>

    <p class="detail">
        Although once considered to be unrealistically futuristic, versions of the universal translator already exist. This means
        that in the future, if you are a tourist in a foreign country and talk to the locals, you will see subtitles in your
        contact lens, as if you were watching a foreign-language movie. You can also have your computer create an audio translation
        that is fed into your ears. This means that it may be possible to have two people carry on a conversation, with each
        speaking in their own language, while hearing the translation in their ears, if both have the universal translator.
        The translation won’t be perfect, since there are always problems with idioms, slang, and colorful expressions, but
        it will be good enough so you will understand the gist of what that person is saying.

        There are several ways in which scientists are making this a reality. The first is to create a machine that can convert the
        spoken word into writing. In the mid-1990s, the first commercially available speech recognition machines hit the
        market. They could recognize up to 40,000 words with 95 percent accuracy. Since a typical, everyday conversation
        uses only 500 to 1,000 words, these machines are more than adequate. Once the transcription of the human voice is
        accomplished, then each word is translated into another language via a computer dictionary. Then comes the hard part:
        putting the words into context, adding slang, colloquial expressions, etc., all of which require a sophisticated
        understanding of the nuances of the language. The field is called CAT (computer assisted translation).
