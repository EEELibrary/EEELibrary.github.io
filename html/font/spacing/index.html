    <h1>Spacing and color</h1>

    <h3> line-height & letter-spacing</h3>
    <p class="one">
        On block level elements,
        <br> the line-height property specifies the minimum
        <br> height of line boxes within the element.
    </p>
    <h3>word-spacing & color</h3>
    <p class="two">
        The letter-spacing CSS property specifies spacing behavior between text characters. In typography, letter spacing is known
        as kerning. The word-spacing CSS property specifies the spacing behavior between words. The color property sets the
        foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of
        the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons. Note
        that the color value must be a uniform color, which may include a transparency value from CSS3 onwards.
